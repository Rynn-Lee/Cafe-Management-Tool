## ü§î What's this project?
I've had been developing this as a commercial project<br>
But the customer decided not to switch from their previous product to a new one<br>
So this project is kind of abandoned now<br>
It was supposed to be a more minimalistic and UI friendly alternative for R-Keeper<br>
Also i really improved my understanding of how React and NextJS work with this one<br>
Also this project has an interesting ability to work with thermal printers :D. Who know JS can do that<br>

## üíª What tech stack is used?
Front-end: NextJS, Sass<br>
Back-end: NodeJS, node-thermal-printer, ping<br>
Database: MongoDB, mongoose<br>
State management: context-api <br>
API: Axios, formidable <br>
SWR: react-query<br>

## ‚úèÔ∏è How it looks like?
